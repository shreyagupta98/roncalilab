            We develop multiscale modeling and simulation tools for quantitative imaging and personalized
            medicine, with an emphasis on imaging physics and nuclear medicine.
            <br><br>
            Because our goal is to
            develop create quantitative computational models, a core concept is to inform these models
            with clinical images and experimental data obtained from our close collaborators.
            We are currently pursuing two research directions related to nuclear medicine.
            <ul>
              <li>We create in silico models of radiation detectors to advance the technology of positron
            emission tomography (PET). Projects include new optical Monte Carlo simulation
            models, studying the underlying physics of ultrafast detectors, optimization of detector
            design for time-of-flight PET.</li>
              <li>We are developing quantitative dosimetry methods for targeted radionuclide therapy,
            with a special interest in liver radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres,
            computational fluid dynamics to model the microsphere transport, quantitative imaging
            of yttrium-90, and multiscale dosimetry physics. The ultimate goal of this research is to

            <p style="margin: 5px 0 30px 0;">
              Targeted radionuclide therapy is a type of radiation therapy based on radiolabeled molecules or
              particles. These radiolabeled particles or molecules are injected systemically or locoregionally
              to target tumors with short-range radiation to minimize the effect of radiation of surrounding
              tissues. If attached to a tumor marker, the radionuclide has the potential to reach disseminated
              tumors (e.g. metastases) with limited radiotoxicity, which makes it extremely attractive and has
              recently accelerated the development of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals.
              <br><br>Targeted radionuclide therapy uniquely sits between external beam radiation therapy and
              chemotherapy and is typically utilized with little consideration for the dosimetry. In the era of
              personalized medicine, it becomes critical to develop dosimetry methods that estimate or
              calculate patient-specific radiation dose distributions, before or after treatment and that could
              ultimately be routinely applied clinically.
              <br><br>Our lab combines engineering principles and translational research to develop quantitative
              dosimetry methods personalized for each patient. We focus on two types of radionuclide
              therapies administered at UC Davis Health: yttrium-90 radioembolization and lutetium 177
              based therapies.
            </p>
            <h5 class="panel__title">CFDose: Dosimetry for Radioembolization Treatment Planning</h5>
            <p style="margin: 5px 0 30px 0;">
              Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a loco-regional radionuclide therapy based on the
              delivery of radioactive yttrium-90 microspheres to liver tumors. Accurate pretreatment
              dosimetry is necessary to determine the Y-90 activity to inject to optimize the dose to the
              tumor while sparing the rest of the liver. Combined with monitoring of the patient response to
              treatment, it could result in much greater increase in patient survival than what recent clinical
              trials have demonstrated.
              <br><br>We are developing patient-specific dosimetry (CFDose) combining computational fluid
              dynamics (CFD) simulation and Y-90 microsphere decay physics to estimate the volumetric dose
              distribution in the liver. We segment the hepatic arterial tree from the Cone-beam CT images
              obtained during treatment planning for each patient. Using multiscale modeling, we carry out
              CFD simulations for each patient’s anatomy, estimating the blood flow distribution and
              microsphere transport. We then compute the radiation dose distribution from the microsphere
              distribution using a dose point kernel.
              <br><br>Our long-term goal is developing a tool integrated in the clinical workflow to assist physicians
              with optimizing the quantity and injection site of Y-90 microspheres during radioembolization
              planning. Current research includes improving the personalization of the CFD simulation,
              developing strategies to speed up the computation, optimizing the dosimetry calculation using
              multiscale modeling

            <p style="margin: 5px 0 30px 0;">
              In parallel to dose prediction, we are also developing quantitative imaging to measure the Y-90
              microsphere distribution after treatment, using Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This
              translational research is carried out within the Department of Radiology at UC Davis Health, in
              three locations including the new EXPLORER Molecular Imaging Center (EMIC) where we are
              evaluating the impact of high-sensitivity PET on Y-90 quantification using total-body PET. WE
              are computing the dose distribution from the PET images.

              Challenges we are solving include optimizing the reconstruction of the low signal Y-90 PET
              images, developing quantitative comparison of the Y-90 PET dose distribution with CFDose
              estimates, incorporating anatomical information from other imaging modalities such as CT to
              segment tumors and improve quantification.

            <p style="margin: 5px 0 30px 0;">
              Monte Carlo simulations are extensively used to design radiation detectors and predict medical
              imaging system performance. Accurate modeling of radiation detectors, typically composed of
              a semiconductor or a scintillation crystal coupled to a photodetector, is required to predict
              performance. One of the basic principles of these detectors is the generation of a large number
              of optical photons (7,0000-60,000) when the incident high-energy particle interacts with the
              scintillator. The number of optical photons produced is proportional to the energy of the
              particle; efficiently collecting these photons is essential to achieve high performance of the
              detector.
              <br><br>Until recently, simulation tools used to study radiation detectors for nuclear medicine were
              designed for high-energy physics and only included simplistic models to track visible photons
              emitted in the scintillator. Since the spatial and temporal distribution of light defines the
              spatial, energy, and timing resolution of detectors, this is a huge limitation. We developed a
              new optical model, the “LUT Davis model”, based on measured 3D crystal surfaces and ray
              tracing with data stored in optical look-up-tables (LUTs). This work was validated in a series of
              benchtop experiments with positron emission tomography detectors and implemented in one
              of the widespread physics simulation software GATE (2000 users world-wide) in 2017.
              The Roncali lab is one of the 22 international partners of the openGATE collaboration that
              develops, maintains this opensource software, and organizes user worskhops and trainings.

              Our current work focuses on the development and validation of new optical surfaces with novel
              reflectors, and the implementation of free computational tools to allow scientists to
              independently design and test optical surfaces tailored to their application.

            <h5 class="panel__title">Ultrafast radiation detectors using prompt photons</h5>
            <p style="margin: 5px 0 30px 0;">
              Cerenkov emission in scintillators only takes ~10 ps, much faster than scintillation (10-300 ns). It
              is a promising alternative for timing triggering to achieve ultra-fast detectors with timing
              resolution of less than 100 ps, but very few photons are produced (10-20 per 511 keV
              photoelectric interaction). Cerenkov-based detectors must minimize the travel time in the
              crystal, maximize the photon collection, and employ photodetectors that generate a fast signal
              to trigger on these prompt photons. We are applying our unique optical modeling tools to study
              these combined factors and have demonstrated that our simulations can explain complex
              timing patterns measured reported by several international research groups.
            </p>

            <p>
              These tools are critical to develop the next generation of ultrafast detectors. We are now
              pushing the frontiers of Cerenkov-based detectors by studying and optimizing the use of
              Cerenkov light in semi-conductor radiation detectors.
